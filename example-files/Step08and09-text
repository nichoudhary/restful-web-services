##### Section 6 | Step 08 & Step 09 -  Implementing GET Methods for User Resource & POST Methods to create user.

In this step 8, we will first create a user resource and implement GET methods.
We'll do a configuration change to treat date as date rather than as a timestamp. If we check the network tab, we can see
that for successful response, we see a status of 200, that's what a spring MVC framework does by default.

In this step 9, we will use post mapping to create users.
For POST requests, we'd want to be more specific in terms of status code. We'd want to return a status code called created.
// input -> details of user
// output -> CREATED & Return the created URI
What we want to do is, once we get a request with the body, we'd need to map it to a user. So, the input for this is user
object. So say that this is the body of the request, we use @RequestMapping annotation on the parameter.

To be able to execute a POST request, we need a simple REST client (POSTMAN) or we can do this from command line as well.
