##### Section 6 | Step 20 - Configuring Auto Generation of Swagger

Let's say we want to share our Restful services with our consumers. If the client asks what does the contract offer your
services? How would they know what would be the response/request format? In SOAP we had wizdler but in RESTful services
there is no standard. What we'd be using in this type is something called swagger. Swagger is one of the popular documentation
format for RESTful services in the state. We'll look at how to document our services using swagger. All that we need to do
is we need to add in a couple of swagger dependencies. -> springfox-swagger2

After we've added the dependencies, we need to configure swagger class. Things we need to do in this class.
-> Tell this is a configuration class
-> Enable swagger for this class
-> Define a Docket bean in this class
    -> In this bean we need to configue
    ---> swagger2
    ---> All the paths
    ---> All the apis

After doing all this, re-start the service and goto:
 http:localhost:8080/v2/api-docs
 http:localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html or http:localhost:8080/swagger-ui

// Added this to application.properties to resolve Null Pointer Exception due to some kind of dependency conflict.
