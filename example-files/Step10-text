##### Section 6 | Step 10 - Enhancing POST Method to return correct HTTP Status Code and Location

In this step, we will return the status of user created. It is a good practice to return a status called created whenever we
want to return the fact that a resource is created.

Another thing is that the client doesn't know the id of the user created as we are not sending him that detail.

First thing, to set the return status as created, we will use something called response entity. Response Entity is something
which is already part of the Spring Framework. If you look at the response entity, it's basically a extension of HTTP entity.
However, additional thing which we can return with this is status code. When we use the created method in response entity,
we'd be able to pass in what was the location of the resource which was created.

Now, how do I create the URI for the location of the resource/object that is being created? There is something called
ServletUriComponentsBuilder

Now we will use -
URI location =
ServletUriComponentsBuilder.
fromCurrentRequest().                --> /user
path("/{id}").                       --> /user + /{id}
buildAndExpand(savedUser.getId()).   --> to replace id with actual id of the saved user
toUri();                             --> to convert it to the uri = /user/4

The resulting location will now be returned as http://localhost:8080/users/4 in the header of the response.
