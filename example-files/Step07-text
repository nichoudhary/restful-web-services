##### Section 6 | Step 07 -  Creating User Bean and User Service

Now we'd start shifting our attention to creating the real resources, users and posts. What we'll do is, in the initial part
of the course we'll use a static array list to represent all about data. We'll not talk to a database. After learning about
JPA, we'll convert all our resources to use JPA and storing it to in-memory database.

So, after we've created a User class, to manage the user we will create something called user DAO. User DAO The user DAO would
be something which would be usually talking to the database and getting the details back. But right now in this example, we will
use a static array list in the user DAO service.

Since we want this user dao service to be managed by spring, we will put @component annotation to this.
