##### Section 6 | Step 26 - Versioning RESTful Service

Why do you need versioning? Let's create a person class first, which contains name. Over the period of time, we realised that Person should
have separate first name and last name. And so we created a PersonV2 with first and last name. However, the old consumers will expect a
response with just name. How do we solve this problem? So, for the same API we need to have 2 different versions. With v1 returning just name
and v2 returning first and last name.

How do we create two diff versions of the same service/API? What are the different options available to us?

One simple way of versioning services is by mapping different URIs to them.
-> @GetMapping("/v1/person")
-> @GetMapping("/v2/person")

This is a basic way of versioning.
