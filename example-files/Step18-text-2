##### Section 6 | Step 18 - Part2 : Internationalization

Simplify the Internationalization implementation that we've done earlier.
Instead of proving locale in the requestHeader [@RequestHeader(value = "Accept-Language", required = false) Locale locale]
we can directly use LocaleContextHolder.getLocale() as if locale was to be used in every request as header then
appending the RequestHeader(.....) in every method would be a very tedious task.

One other things we need to fix is instead of SessionLocaleResolver, we need to use AcceptHeaderLocaleResolver.

Also, as we are using ResourceBundleMessageSource to set messageSource.setBasename("messages"). We can remove this whole
method and directly set this property in application.properties.
