##### Section 6 | Step 11 - Implementing Exception Handling - 404 Resource Not Found

One of the key fact about creating resources/objects/things is returning correct response status back. In the prev step,
we returned proper response of created on creation of resources. However, what would happen if something goes wrong? when
a user is not found? What should be the response that should be returned back?

Execute a request for a user which doesn't exist - GET http://localhost:8080/users/500, we will 200 OK successful status
with an empty body. Even though the resource doesn't exist, we are sending a successful response back. That's a very bad
practice.

Let's fix that...

To return a specific response status code during exception, we can map the specific exception class to return that particular
response code using @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND) annotation.

One of the things that we'd always need to remember is it's important to have consistent exception message which is returned
back for all the services inside your enterprise. If you have big organization and each of the services returns the exception
messages in a different way then it's not good. There should be a standard exception structure which should be followed across
all RESTful services.
