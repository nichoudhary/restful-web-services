##### Section 6 | Step 25 - Implementing Dynamic Filtering for RESTful Service

In this video, we'll explore the idea of dynamic filtering. Let's say for some requests we need to send field1, field2 and
for other requests we'd want to send field2 and field3. This is where the concept of Dynamic Filtering comes in. With Dynamic
Filtering we cannot configure filtering directly on the bean. What we need to do is, we need to start configuring the filtering
where they're retrieving the values. We'll apply filtering in the Filtering Controller itself.

We apply dynamic filtering using a class called MappingJacksonValue(response), in this class we can configure filters.

/*
        SomeBean someBean = new SomeBean("field1", "field2", "field3");
        SimpleBeanPropertyFilter filter = SimpleBeanPropertyFilter.filterOutAllExcept("field1", "field2");
        FilterProvider filters = new SimpleFilterProvider().addFilter("SomeBeanFilter", filter);
        MappingJacksonValue mapping = new MappingJacksonValue(someBean);
        mapping.setFilters(filters);
        return mapping;
